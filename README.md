# cppgen
This is just a basic password generator using c++ and uses what I think may be okay for randomly selecting letters. (I don't know much if anything about rng with c++.)

Also this is kinda my first attempt at making something with c++, Many people when making new things will make a simple hello world script. Whereas, I like to make password generators. If you can make a password generator in a different language then you'll definitely learn something along the way.

If you like what I have made then leave a star! ‚≠ê and feel free to share!
